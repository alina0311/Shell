# Shell
A command-line program designed in **C** in a team of 3 students for The Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics, University of Bucharest.

As [**Wikipedia**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shell_(computing)) says: 
>In computing, a shell is a computer program which exposes an operating system's services to a human user or other program. In general, operating system shells use either a command-line interface (CLI) or graphical user interface (GUI), depending on a computer's role and particular operation. It is named a shell because it is the outermost layer around the operating system.
